Generic single-database configuration.
This project is a Python-based Freebie Tracker using SQLAlchemy ORM with a SQLite database.
It models companies giving freebies to developers, tracking items, values, and relationships.

Setup Instructions
Clone the repo

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd python-p3-freebie-tracker
Create and activate your virtual environment (optional but recommended)

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install dependencies

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Initialize the database schema
Run the following in a Python shell or add a script:

python
Copy
Edit
from models import Base
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

engine = create_engine('sqlite:///freebies.db')
Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
Seed the database
Run the seed script to populate initial data:

bash
Copy
Edit
python lib/seed.py
Run the debug session
Start an interactive session to explore your data models:

bash
Copy
Edit
python lib/debug.py
Project Structure
models.py — Contains SQLAlchemy models for Company, Dev, and Freebie with relationships and instance methods.

lib/seed.py — Script to add sample data to the database.

lib/debug.py — Debug script to query and inspect database contents interactively.

freebies.db — SQLite database file created after running the seed script.

Instance Methods
Company.give_freebie(dev, item_name, value) — Adds a freebie for a dev.

Dev.received_one(item_name, value, company) — Checks if a dev received a specific freebie.

Dev.freebies_list() — Returns a list of freebies a dev has received.

Notes
The project uses naming conventions for database constraints to keep schema clean and maintainable.

Designed for learning ORM relationships, instance methods, and SQLite integration.

How to Extend
Add more instance methods or queries.

Build a CLI or web interface to interact with the tracker.

Add user input validation and error handling.
